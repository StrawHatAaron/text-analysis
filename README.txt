1. Aaron Miller and Travis Keri

2. We started the project on 10/16/2017 till 11/3/2017

3. Both of us expected the Hash Table to be the fastest.

4. Which data structure is the fastest? Why were you right or wrong?

5. In general, which DataCounter dictionary implementation was "better": trees or hash tables? Note that you will need to define "better" (ease of coding, ease
   of debugging, memory usage, disk access patterns, runtime for average input, runtime for all input, etc).
   
   a. For the life of this project implementing the AVL was much easier because we had already done so in the previous project. It also didn't require debugging.
   
   b. 
   
6. Are there cases in which a particular data structure performs really well or badly in the Correlator? Enumerate the cases for each data structure.

   BST:

   AVL:
   
   Hash Table:   

7. Give a one to two paragraph explanation of whether or not you think Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays based on the data you collected. 
   No fancy statistical analysis here (formal analysis comes later); keep it fun and simple.

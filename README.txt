1. Aaron Miller and Travis Keri

2. We started the project on 10/16/2017 till 11/3/2017

3. Both of us expected the Hash Table to be the fastest.

4. The hashtable was the fastest, we were correct.

5. It is hard to determine which of these is "better". While the accessing the hash table is faster, but in terms of ease of coding and debugging the AVL would be better.  Also in terms of sorting the data the AVL is also better because you can sort the data while it is in the tree.
   
6. Are there cases in which a particular data structure performs really well or badly in the Correlator? Enumerate the cases for each data structure.

   BST:

   AVL:
   
   Hash Table:   

7. Give a one to two paragraph explanation of whether or not you think Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays based on the data you collected. 
   No fancy statistical analysis here (formal analysis comes later); keep it fun and simple.
There is some chance that Sir Bacon wrote Shakespeare but most likely not

8.We measured the time it takes to build the data sturcture and the time to access it. We did this with the System.nanoTime() method. Possible sources of error would be in the accessing benchmark, we are also timing how long it takes to print everthing out which will give us a longer time

9.This assignment was alright, we did learned how to implement a hash table. However, getting it to work with the generics was a nightmare.
